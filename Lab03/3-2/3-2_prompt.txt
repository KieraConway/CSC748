This one should be quite straight forward. Remember, the stack cookie is ONLY meant to protect the function's return address and saved frame-pointer. Other variables on the stack may be overwritten before the stack cookie is reached. Can you trick this program into popping a shell without even bothering to overwrite the return address?

Why pick the lock when you can simply remove the hinges. :)
