Lab 2-2
100
Nearly the same challenge as Lab 2-1, but without that handy "win()" function to just jump to. For this one you'll need to craft some shellcode of own, place it on the stack, then find a way to redirect the instruction pointer to it. Can you find an instruction somewhere within the programs code which will redirect execution to the stack? :)

Fun fact, this is nearly the same attack that Aleph One described in his seminal paper "Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit" back in 1996! A must read for those entering the field of software exploitation.
