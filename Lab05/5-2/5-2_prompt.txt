Lab 5-2
100
This challenge may look familiar, as it's repurposed from a previous lab problem. This time you'll need to bypass ASLR to get your shell though!

The second demo shown in the lecture is relevant here. Think small, and simple. No fancy ROP chains or shellcode necessary, a single byte should be sufficient. :)
